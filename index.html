            <h3>Integrated search</h3>

            <p>If your are logged into <b>AniList</b> through <b>AL Search</b>, the extension will also return anime and manga on your lists.</p>

            <p><b>AL Search</b> also adds a button on pages from a few websites related to anime and manga.</p>
            <p>The button will (almost) always contains two links, the first one <b><i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></b> to visit the related page on <b>AniList</b> and the second one <b><i class="fa fa-search"></i></b> to open <b>AniList</b> search page.</p>

            <h3>Browser search provider (Firefox only)</h3>

            <p><b>AL Search</b> adds an anime search engine to the browser.</p>
            <p>Starting your search using the keyword <b>ani</b>, the browser will automatically switch to this search engine and execute an anime search on <b>AniList</b>.</p>

            <h4>Supported websites</h4>

                </tbody>
            </table>

            <h4>Planned</h4>

            <p>None for now. If you think some websites should be added, feel free to contact me.</p>
            <p>The following websites are currently <strong>not</strong> planned as I, the creator of <b>AL Search</b>, do not have access to these websites: <a href="https://www.hulu.com">Hulu</a>.</p>
            <p>The following websites are currently <strong>not</strong> planned because there is no reliable way to differentiate anime shows from other type of shows available on the service: </strong><a href="https://www.netflix.com" target="_blank">Netflix</a> and <a href="https://www.primevideo.com/" target="_blank">Prime Video</a>.</p>
            <p class="note">Note: </strong><a href="https://www.hidive.com" target="_blank">Hidive</a> was removed with v2 rewrite since I can't test if it still works.</p>

            <h4>Known limitations</h4>

            <p>It is virtually impossible to link every page on every website the extension could support to a related page on <b>AniList</b>. So the extension will always use the best match on <b>AniList</b> based on the page you are currently viewing to generate the <b><i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></b> link. For instance, if you are currently on the <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/jojos-bizarre-adventure">Jojo's Bizarre Adventure anime page on <i>Crunchyroll</i></a>, the extension will execute an anime search for "Jojo's Bizarre Adventure" and take the best match from the search results.</p>
            <p>Be also aware that if you are browsing a website in a different language than English, the search results can return wrong data as <b>AniList</b> database is in English.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card" id="search-provider-details">
            <h3>About the search provider</h3>

            <h4>Why only on Firefox?</h4>

            <p>The search provider is only available on Firefox due to restrictions on Chrome.</p>
            <p>To make it short, Chrome does not allow an extension to add a search provider for a website not owned by the creator of the extension. Therefore, it is impossible to add a search provider for <b>AniList</b>, or any other website, if the extension is not developed by the website owner.</p>

            <h4>Why only anime?</h4>

            <p>It is impossible to define multiple search providers per extension, and it is impossible to have multiple search urls for a single search provider. Since <b>AniList</b> does not have a global search page, the extension can only add one search provider limited to one type of data.</p>
            <p>Anime was choosen because it is the main data on the website.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>About translation</h3>

            <p>The extension is currently translated in English and French.</p>
            <p>Please keep in mind that while the extension is translated, data on <b>AniList</b> are not and will always be in English.</p>
